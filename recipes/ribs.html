    <h2>How to make Slow-cooked Barbeque Ribs</h2>

    <p>An easy and delicious way to prepare tender barbecued ribs without the barbecue!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>4 pounds pork baby back ribs</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 cups ketchup</li>
            <li>1 cup chili sauce</li>
            <li>1½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons vinegar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 dash hot sauce</li>
            

        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
